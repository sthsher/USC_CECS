CS 104 Homework 4 README

----------------
    Makefile
----------------
use the makefile in this directory

To make question 2:
	< make question2 >
To make question 3:
	< make question3 >

or use the command
	< make all >
to compile both files

To remove executibles:
	< make clean >

DO NOT USE MAKEFILE WITHIN THE SUBDIRECTORIES. THE PATH FILES WILL BE DIFFERENT AND THE PROGRAM WILL NOT RUN
	Just make and run executibles from this directory

----------------
   Question 2
----------------
Feel free to run the program. It will take a while to finish.
The results and graph are in the file:

< Question 2 Answer Document.pdf >

In the classes, if you see lines containing "this->pureSize" or "this->pureNumberOfElements", they have been commented out since they were used for debugging purposes

----------------
   Question 3
----------------
The input file follows the format as suggested in the assignment document.
Simply run the program to see the result of the recursion. It will output who to invite and the final fun-factor number.
The linked list class is a modified linked list with functions that are designed specifically for this assignment. They are:

dataType* convertToArray:			converts the linked list into an array to keep track of the list of people to invite
int returnSize:						returns the size of the linked list. Also needed to keep track of the number of people to invite

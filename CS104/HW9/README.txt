Homework 9 Readme

Question 2 answer is in the pdf document.

Use the makefile to make question 3, 4, and 5. Typing:

	<make>

will make the following files:

	Q3.cpp
	Q4.cpp
	Q5.cpp

For question 3 and 4, the program will read the text file "Q3_text_file.txt" and "Q4_text_file.txt" respectively. Feel free to change the content of the text file as long as it follows the set format.

Question 5:
While the program will use "student ID", feel free to use student names. As long as the name remains as one string (no spaces).

In the menu, type 'p' or 'P' to print out the 2,3 tree. You will have to draw out the tree yourself starting from the root at position 0. Make sure to follow the index of the children. The program does not collect garbage, so at certain points there will be unused content in the vectors (eg. index 4 might not be any node's children)

Have fun!

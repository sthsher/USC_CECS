The
Venue
What
do
you
want
to
get
out
of
performing
in
a
restaurant
Do
you
just
want
to
work
on
your
chops
Is
it
money
Are
you
looking
for
a
place
to
simply
network
and
pass
out
business
cards
Is
it
a
springboard
for
you
to
get
corporate
work
and
private
parties
What
venue
you
should
seek
out
depends
on
how
you
answer
those
questions
Obviously
more
upper
class
people
and
executive
types
will
frequent
a
high-end
establishment
A
sports
bar
will
have
more
of
a
tendency
to
draw
people
who
like
drinking
and
less
likely
to
be
a
captive
audience
A
franchise
restaurant
like
TGIFriday
will
have
more
of
a
family
atmosphere
The
Shotgun
Method
When
I
first
attempted
to
land
a
restaurant
I
called
about
100
restaurants
and
gave
them
my
spiel
Two
of
them
bit
I
ended
up
performing
at
both
of
those
establishments
for
three
years
before
I
moved
to
Dallas
TX
All
you
need
is
one
to
bite
This
method
does
work
but
I
think
I
was
lucky
too
Since
then
I
have
changed
my
approach
Cold
calling
is
not
fun
for
me
Telemarketers
call
all
day
and
your
call
will
be
no
different
to
them
them
being
restaurant
management
Not
only
that
but
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
say
NO
over
the
phone
than
it
is
in
person
Chain
or
Privately
Owned
Privately
owned
higher
end
restaurants
are
my
primary
targets
Usually
you
can
talk
directly
to
the
owner
Any
time
you
can
sell
the
owner
you
are
probably
in
Chain
restaurants
like
Macaroni
Grill
and
The
Cheesecake
Factory
are
much
harder
to
get
into
because
they
have
to
go
through
corporate
red
tape
to
get
approval
for
an
entertainer

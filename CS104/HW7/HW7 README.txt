HW7 README

Makefile:

simply type:

	<make>

to make both cpp files

Classes:
	heap.h / heap.hpp
	The class for the heap. Allows maxHeap and minHeap and any number for d larger or equal to 2

	WARNING: DO NOT MAKE A HEAP WITH VALUE OF D LESS THAN 2
	or else the code and I will be very sad and throw a tantrum

	student.h / student.hpp
	The class for the student records. A very simple and standard class.

Cpp files:

	HW7.cpp / HW7
	This is the code for question 4. The code will:

		Add 10,000 random integers ranging between 1 and 10,000
		Remove 10,000 random integers ranging between 1 and 10,000
		Test for values of d of: 2, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90
		Display the corresponding run times

	studentRecords.cpp / studentRecords
	This is the code for question 5. Feel free to add as many students as you want

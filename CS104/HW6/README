README for Homework 6!

class doubleArraySize is the class that doubles its size when need be
class LListSet is a doubly linked list bag

The data text file <user_info_file.txt> is the file that holds the user's information and their posts. It has its own specific format so please avoid using other files. The filename is hardcoded in so also avoid changing the file name

in Sherbook.cpp

feel free to create a new account and play around

If you login with the folloing information:

First Name: 	admin
Last Name: 		admin
Password: 		admin

You will access the admin menu. There you can view all the users and delete any user you want.

If you delete a user, then the user will be removed from all the other users's network and pending requests.
Delete at risk

There is an easter egg in the program. Feel free to find it. However if you look at the cpp file it will give it away and it will be no more fun

Makefile:

simply type <make> to compile all the files
type <make clean> to remove the executible files

README for Homework 3!

Classes <LListSet> and <LListElement> are both template classes
They are from homework 2 and from the class examples so they are standard

Question 3 corresponds to class wallPost
Question 4 corresponds to class wall
Question 5 corresponds to class user
Question 5 corresponds to class userList

The data text file <user_info_file.txt> is the file that holds the user's information and their posts. It has its own specific format so please avoid using other files. The filename is hardcoded in so also avoid changing the file name

In HW3.cpp:

feel free to create a new account and play around

If you login with the folloing information:

First Name: 	admin
Last Name: 		admin
Password: 		admin

You will access the admin menu. There you can view all the users and delete any user you want.

There is an easter egg in the program. Feel free to find it. However if you look at the cpp file it will give it away and it will be no more fun

Makefile:

simply type <make> to compile all the files
type <make clean> to remove the executible files
